## ⚙️ Development Notes
This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vite.dev).

It provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)
